## The Alternative Polybius Converter

This is a simple program that will encode and decode a string using something similar to a Polybius square.

To use this program, run the program, use the terminal to determine if you're (e)ncoding or (d)ecoding with the following letters.

Then type in your string or copy & paste it.

The output will either be something you've decoded or encoded.
